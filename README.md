# Hotel Management Master: Business Plan
Between 2016 and 2017, we developed an innovative business plan for a hotel and coworking space that specifically targeted digital nomads and millennials. Our approach emphasized connecting guests with the local community by opening up the hotel space for local activities.

The hotel business plan included comprehensive market research, a detailed marketing plan, an operational plan, a human resources plan, a financial plan, and a corporate social responsibility plan.
